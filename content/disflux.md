# Disflux

---

**Disflux** is a unique audio effect plugin that transforms your transients, adding punch and weight. Ideal for genres like **Hard Techno**, **Dubstep** or **Rawstyle**, it helps create kicks that hit with unmatched intensity.

By utilizing a chain of all-pass filters, **Disflux** spreads high-energy transients through time, producing a laser-like effect. It's like combining a short reverb with a falling sine wave, injecting depth and impact into your sound. Beyond kicks, it's perfect for crafting experimental soundscapes and other innovative audio effects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Compiling

---

If you want to compile Plasma from source yourself, follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites

**Ubuntu**

- Install build tools: `sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake ninja-build`
- Install dependencies: `sudo apt install libasound2-dev libjack-jackd2-dev ladspa-sdk libcurl4-openssl-dev libfreetype-dev libfontconfig1-dev libx11-dev libxcomposite-dev libxcursor-dev libxext-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev libxrender-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev curl`

**MacOS**

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
2. Install build tools: `brew install ninja osxutils`

**Windows**

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
3. Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)
4. Install Ninja `choco install ninja`

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Disflux.git
cd Disflux
```

### 3. Configure the Build with CMake

Run CMake to configure the project. Use the appropriate preset for your platform:

**Ubuntu**

```bash
cmake --preset "Linux Release"
```

**MacOS**

```bash
cmake --preset "Mac Release" -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64"
```

**Windows**

```bash
cmake --preset "Windows Release"
```

### 4. Build the project

After configuring with CMake, build the project using the following command:

```bash
cmake --build build --config "Release"
```

### 5. Locate the Build Artifacts

After the build process completes, you can find the compiled artifacts in the build directory under the following paths:

- **VST3:** `build/src/DisfluxPlugin_artefacts/Release/VST3/Disflux.vst3`
- **CLAP:** `build/src/DisfluxPlugin_artefacts/Release/CLAP/Disflux.clap`
- **LV2:** `build/src/DisfluxPlugin_artefacts/Release/LV2/Disflux.lv2`
- **AU:** `build/src/DisfluxPlugin_artefacts/Release/AU/Disflux.component`

You can move these to your plugin folder.

## üîê Privacy

---

**Disflux** is built with privacy in mind. It **does not collect any personal data** or send any telemetry. We are committed to **never sharing or selling your data**. It makes us sad that in today's day and age, we consider this to be a standout point, but here we are.

### Update Checking

On some systems, **Disflux** includes a lightweight and anonymous update notification system. It checks for new versions by sending a simple GET request to our server to retrieve the latest version string. The system then compares the retrieved version with the current version locally. No personal data is sent or stored during this process.

### Disabling Update Notifications

If you'd rather disable the update notification system, you can compile **Disflux** without it by adding the following CMake flag:

```bash
-DDMT_DISABLE_UPDATE_NOTIFICATION=ON
```

Some pre-built versions, like those available from the **Arch User Repository (AUR)**, may already have this option enabled by default. This is because these builds are managed by package managers that handle updates on their own, making the update check unnecessary.

### Third-Party Tools and Telemetry

We use third-party libraries, such as [JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE), to help with plugin development. While we are not aware of any telemetry or data collection within these tools, we recommend you do your own research to ensure you are comfortable with their data practices.

If we discover any issues or unexpected data collection, we will address them immediately and update you accordingly.
